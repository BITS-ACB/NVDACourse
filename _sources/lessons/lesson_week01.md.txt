## Terminology

**NVDA:**

Non visual Desktop Access. A screen reader for Windows. It is free and donation-supported. Similar to Narrator and JAWS. Does not run on Mac or tablets. Current version: 2025.1.2

**Control:**

An item onscreen. A check box, an edit field and a list item are all controls. When you point to a file on your system it is a control. When you open a ribbon or menu, each item there is a control.

**Focus:**

This is where you are currently located in Windows. If you have a cursor, sometimes called an insertion point, where it points is the focus. If you have no cursor, your "keyboard focus" is a dotted outline around a control. If you were using a mouse, the focus would be at the point where you would click. NVDA attempts to automatically read the text, graphic or control that has focus. Your focus is usually on a specific character, if there's a cursor or a specific control, if there is no cursor.

**Preferences:**

This is the menu for configuring NVDA. Most often you will choose Settings under the Preferences menu though other more advanced choices exist.

**NVDA Key:**

This is either Insert key or the caps lock key. Hold it down with another keystroke to issue an NVDA command.

**Navigator Object:**

This is where NVDA is currently pointing. The navigator object can often be pointed at the focus, but it also can be moved away to read other portions of the application.

## Installing it

1. Go to [NVDA's Website](http://www.nvaccess.org)
2. From the menu choose download.
3. Ensure the radio button for "no donation is checked (unless you do wish to donate now) then hit the download button.
4. The file you download is "nvda_2025.1.2.exe".
5. Locate and focus on the file in your downloads folder and press Enter to run it. You will be walked through its installation.

## Basics

NVDA reads text and controls as you encounter them, AS you move through files and folders, the item on which you are focused is voiced.

If you tab between controls the one landed on is read. If you type text, you can set NVDA to read by characters, by words or by both or none. This is all you need to know to work with it in a very basic way. Explore you desktop, start menu and taskbar with NVDA.

Success with NVDA occurs when you become proficient with Windows and the applications you intend to use. Windows learning resources are at the end of this document.
