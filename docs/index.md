# Welcome to the BITS-ACB NVDA Course

## Preface

This is the very beginning of what might be the way we document the course.
Nothing is set in stone, this is here for people to take a look and comment.

## High Level Docs Description

I'm using Python's sphinx package with the pydata-spinx-theme.
Docs are published on github pages using a github action.
All content is written in markdown with anything fancy using myst-parser defined extensions. 

Cheers!!
