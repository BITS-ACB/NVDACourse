## Terminology

### **Element**

An item on a web page. Elements include links, headings, lists, paragraphs and form fields like check boxes and radio buttons. Jus as Windows applications use controls, websites use elements.

### **Single-letter navigation**

A method that lets screen reader users press a single keystroke to navigate to an element on a web page. For example, pressing h moves to the next heading.

### **Browse Mode**

This is similar to the JAWS virtual cursor mode or the Narrator scan mode. It presents a web page as a document comprised of elements that a user can navigate with arrow keys and single-letter navigation keystrokes. When sighted people look at a page with their eyes, they can only read, and not interact using their eyes. This is like  a pair of eyes for viewing a web page. Even if you are interacting, you can easily return to browse mode to read what is around you on the page. Sighted people of course can also look with their eyes while typing with their hands and clicking with their mouse. You need to switch modes to tell NVDA what you want to do.

### **Focus Mode**

This is like the JAWS forms mode. Just as sighted people must use a keyboard or mouse to interact with a web page, you must enter focus mode to interact. When a sighted person clicks on an element they are now focused on it. When we press Enter, we are also interacting with it and focus mode is automatically engaged.

### **Form**

This is any place on a web page where the user can add information. Forms can include radio buttons, check boxes and edit boxes. Forms can also include drop-down lists, spin controls and other less common elements.

### **Rich edit control**

This is a mini word processor built in to a web page. It often has a toolbar and a menu for you to add formatting, such as font, centering, underlining,  boldfacing and even embedding graphics or media. Often an edit box in a form is a rich edit box, which means you can add some formatting but not have the full word processor experience.

## Browser basics

- Edge, Chrome, Firefox. Have all 3 on your system; one is the default and can be changed.
- Use Browse mode for reading, focus mode for interacting.
- Web pages are composed of elements.
- NVDA with F7 is your friend.

### Elements and corresponding keystrokes

|Element | Keystroke |
|------|-------|
| heading| h |
| headings | 1 to 6 |
| list | l |
| list item | i |
| table | t |
| link | k |
| nonLinked text | n |
| unvisited link | u |
| visited link | v |
| form field | f |
| edit field | e |
| button | b |
| checkbox | x |
| combo box | c |
| radio button | r |
| block quote | q |
| separator | s |
| frame | f |
| graphic | g |
| landmark | d |
| embedded object | o |
| annotation| a |
| paragraph | p |
| spelling error | w |

Note: If you forget a single-letter navigation keystroke, use NVDA with the 1 key to enter the key describer mode.

## Finding Text

Press NVDA with Control+F for the Find command. Note this is different from JAWS which uses Control+F. If you press Control+F by mistake, you are using the browser's built-in Find command which will highlight found text but not navigate NVDA to that location.

To find the next occurrence, hold the NVDA key and press F3. Hold NVDA and press Shift-F3 for locating the previous occurrence.

Note: If you know JAWS well, this is a different keystroke. JAWS repurposed the Control-F keystroke for its own find, whereas NVDA leaves Control-F alone.

## Tips

- Press the NVDA key with the spacebar to toggle between focus and browse mode. Press Escape to return to Browse mode and exit focus mode. When in focus mode, therefore, either pressing Escape or the NVDA key with the Spacebar returns you to browse mode.
- If you have navigated to a form element, you can press Enter to make it active, which automatically turns focus mode on. This is the same as clicking on it.
- If your website or application needs to use keystrokes that conflict with single-letter navigation, toggle that NVDA feature off with NVDA + Shift + Spacebar. For example you need to press K to pause a YouTube video and you also use keystrokes with applications like FaceBook, X and the google suite. When you are in focus mode, your keyboard is available, but you need this keystroke in browse mode if you want to remain in browse mode but use some keystrokes for the web application.
- When surveying or skimming an unfamiliar page, use NVDA-F7 for an overview of available elements. If working with a sighted helper, this keystroke helps them see what elements are available.
- Use shift with single-letter navigation keys to move to the previous element of that type.
- Refresh browse mode content with the NVDA key and F5.
- With interfering advertising, use the reader mode. On Edge and Firefox, press F9. On Chrome, you must use an extension as the default feature is activated by clicking an icon; it has no keystroke associated with it.
- To avoid loosing your place on a page, press Shift-Enter to open a link in a new window.
- Tab goes to the next link but can also move you off the web page. Control + F6 will return you to the page content and exit the browser interface.
- Pressing F11 toggles between full-screen mode and a mode where the browser interface is visible.
- Use Alt-Down arrow to open a drop-down list.
- There are two ways to move by paragraph. The single letter navigation keystroke p moves forward past website clutter to get to the next block of text. Once you are reading actual text, you can use control-down arrow and control-up arrow to move between paragraphs within that text.
- To save the content of a link, navigate to it and use the context menu.
- Though h goes to the next heading, you can use numbers to get to specific heading levels once you know a page's layout.
- If NVDA is too chatty on web pages, use the Document Formatting category under Settings to toggle extra verbage off.
- If a page has step-by-step directions you nmeed to follow, try making a recording with your phone or digital recorder so you can listen while trying out the steps on your computer. Remember, you can read from your cursor location to the end by pressing caps lock plus a with laptop mode or the insert plus down arrow in desktop layout.
- Clickable elements are activated when you press Enter on them but you cannot navigate between them with the tab key.
- Sometimes a website is actually accessible but just confusing. Remember sighted people find some websites confusing as well.
- You can always type or paste an address in to the Run Box if you want to call up your default browser and be immediately on the page you want.
- In web-based apps, you will often need to switch frequently between browse mode for reading and focus mode for interacting due to the more interactive nature of web-based apps.
- Many web-based apps will show you a list of keystrokes if you press Control-Slash.
- When you are asked to upload a file with drag and drop, locate the file on Windows file explorer, press Control-C to copy it and return to the drag and drop location and press Control-V to paste the file.
- The keystroke Alt-D takes you to the address bar, which is highlighted so you can copy the URL.
- If a page doesn't seem usable, copy its address, and paste it in to a different browser to see if you can better read it there.

### Copying text from a web page

All versions of NVDA let you use the NVDA key pressed with F9 to start a block of text to copy, then navigate to the end and press F10 once to mark the end of the text or F10 twice quickly to copy it. You can also not copy it right away and simply mark it with NVDA-F9 and NVDA-F10.

Newer versions of NVDA let you use the shift and arrow keys to select text and Control-C to copy, just like JAWS. However this method though more intuitive can be less convenient, as the F9-F10 method makes it easier to read the page and/or locate where you want to end the block to be copied.

### Advanced Surfing

- To work with web-based applications like rich edit controls or media players, press the single-letter navigation key o. This moves to the next object; press Enter to activate it and focus inside of it.
- If you are inside an object, such as a media player or rich edit application, press NVDA+control+space
to exit the object and return to browse mode. This is similar to disabling the JAWS applications cursor.
- NVDA+shift+f10 toggles "native selection" mode, which by default is off. When it's on, if you hold the shift and use arrow keys in focus mode you are selecting text using the browser's or web application's ability to select text. This means you can preserve the formatting, for example, if you wish to copy a table from a website and paste it in to a word processor.  Some web applications require this be toggled on. When it's off, you are using NVDA to select text, which you can paste elsewhere, however all you will be pasting is text without any formatting.
- Shift-Comma moves to the start of a container, such as a list or table.
- If you are inside a container, press the comma key by itself to move outside the container.
- The advanced surfing keystrokes are particularly useful for online courses and web-based applications.

## Possible Homework Ideas

- Research the synthesizer ring, see section 12.1.4.
- Practice using both accessible and more complicated web pages. Be prepared to ask questions.
- If you use JAWS, try exploring the Bits pages with both JAWS and NVDA. What differences do you encounter?
- Research the concept of profiles. Why would you use them? Sec section12.4.
- Research Section ten on content recognition. How does it work?
- Research the concept of input gestures. What keystroke could you add to do more single-letter navigation on websites?

Next week: Object navigation.
